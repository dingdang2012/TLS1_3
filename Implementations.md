Here's a list of implementations of TLS 1.3.  Add your own.  Talk to [@martinthomson](/martinthomson) if you have questions.

# Implementations

name | language | role(s) | [[version|Implementations#version-negotiation]] | features/limitations
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[NSS](https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss) | C | C/S | -13 | FF2048, P-256, no HelloRetryRequest, PSK resumption (*DHE_PSK only), 0-RTT
[Firefox](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central), based on NSS but behind | C++ | C |  -11 | P-256, No HRR, PSK resumption (DHE_PSK only), no 0-RTT
[Mint](https://github.com/bifurcation/mint) | Go | C/S | -11 | PSK resumption
[nqsb](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/tree/tls13) | OCaml | C/S | -11 | PSK/DHE-PSK, no EC*, no client auth, no 0RTT -- live server at tls13test.nqsb.io port 4433, records traces, ping [@hannesm](https://github.com/hannesm), contains a static PSK/DHE_PSK token: id: 0x0000 secret: 0x000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f
ProtoTLS | JavaScript | C/S | -11 | EC/DHE/PSK, no HelloRetryRequest
miTLS | F* | C/S | -11 | EC/DHE/PSK | No HelloRetryRequest
tls-tris | Go | S | -11 | ECDHE | No HelloRetryRequest

# Version Negotiation

Note that most of these implementations signal the draft version in a two-octet extension that uses the code point `0xff02`.  Set this to the integer value of the draft suffix (for example, draft -12 is the value `0x000c`).  Until the final version is released, please require this extension before negotiating TLS 1.3.  If the value is not present, or it doesn't match your implemented version you should negotiate TLS 1.2, or fail.

Implementations of the final version should check for this extension and fail to negotiate TLS 1.3 if it is present.  That check might be removed once sufficient time has passed.
